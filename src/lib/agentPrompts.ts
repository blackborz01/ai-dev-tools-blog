### Schema Design

#### Entity-Relationship Diagram
\`\`\`mermaid
erDiagram
    ENTITY_1 ||--o{ ENTITY_2 : relationship
    ENTITY_1 {
        uuid id PK
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
        string field_1
        integer field_2
    }
    ENTITY_2 {
        uuid id PK
        uuid entity_1_id FK
        string field_3
        json metadata
    }
\`\`\`

#### DDL Statements
\`\`\`sql
-- Main tables with optimal data types and constraints
CREATE TABLE entity_1 (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    field_1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    field_2 INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    field_3 TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    
    -- Constraints
    CONSTRAINT chk_status CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'deleted')),
    CONSTRAINT chk_field_2_positive CHECK (field_2 >= 0)
);

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON TABLE entity_1 IS 'Main entity for storing...';
COMMENT ON COLUMN entity_1.metadata IS 'Flexible JSON storage for additional attributes';

-- Junction table for many-to-many relationships
CREATE TABLE entity_1_entity_2 (
    entity_1_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES entity_1(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    entity_2_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES entity_2(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB,
    
    PRIMARY KEY (entity_1_id, entity_2_id)
);

-- Audit table for tracking changes
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    record_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    changed_by UUID,
    changed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB
);
\`\`\`

### Indexing Strategy

\`\`\`sql
-- Primary indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_status_created ON entity_1(status, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_field_1_lower ON entity_1(LOWER(field_1)) WHERE status = 'active';

-- Partial indexes for specific conditions
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_active ON entity_1(id) WHERE status = 'active';

-- Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_composite ON entity_1(field_1, field_2, created_at DESC);

-- GIN index for JSONB queries
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_metadata ON entity_1 USING GIN (metadata);

-- Full-text search index
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_search ON entity_1 USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', field_1 || ' ' || field_3));

-- Analyze index usage
COMMENT ON INDEX idx_entity_1_status_created IS 'Used for: Dashboard queries, pagination';
\`\`\`

### Partitioning Strategy

\`\`\`sql
-- Partition large tables by date
CREATE TABLE events (
    id BIGSERIAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    data JSONB,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE events_2025_01 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');

CREATE TABLE events_2025_02 PARTITION OF events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-02-01') TO ('2025-03-01');

-- Automated partition management
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partitions()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    start_date DATE;
    end_date DATE;
    partition_name TEXT;
BEGIN
    start_date := DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE);
    end_date := start_date + INTERVAL '1 month';
    partition_name := 'events_' || TO_CHAR(start_date, 'YYYY_MM');
    
    EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF events FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
        partition_name, start_date, end_date);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
\`\`\`

### Query Optimization

#### Common Query Patterns
\`\`\`sql
-- Optimized pagination with cursor
WITH paginated AS (
    SELECT *,
           COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_count
    FROM entity_1
    WHERE status = 'active'
      AND created_at < $1  -- cursor
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT $2
)
SELECT * FROM paginated;

-- Efficient aggregation with window functions
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS daily_count,
    SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)) AS running_total,
    AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS seven_day_avg
FROM entity_1
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at);

-- Optimized search with trigrams
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_entity_1_field_1_trgm ON entity_1 USING GIN (field_1 gin_trgm_ops);

SELECT * FROM entity_1
WHERE field_1 % 'search_term'  -- Fuzzy search
ORDER BY similarity(field_1, 'search_term') DESC
LIMIT 10;
\`\`\`

### Performance Tuning

#### Database Configuration
\`\`\`ini
# PostgreSQL performance tuning (postgresql.conf)
shared_buffers = 25% of RAM
effective_cache_size = 75% of RAM
maintenance_work_mem = 256MB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = 16MB
default_statistics_target = 100
random_page_cost = 1.1  # For SSD
effective_io_concurrency = 200  # For SSD
work_mem = 4MB
max_connections = 200
\`\`\`

#### Query Performance Analysis
\`\`\`sql
-- Enable query logging for slow queries
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 100;  -- Log queries > 100ms

-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT ... FROM entity_1 WHERE ...;

-- Find missing indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND n_distinct > 100
  AND correlation < 0.1
ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;

-- Monitor table bloat
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    round(n_dead_tup::numeric / NULLIF(n_live_tup, 0), 3) AS dead_ratio
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
\`\`\`

### Data Migration Strategy

\`\`\`sql
-- Zero-downtime migration approach
-- Step 1: Add new column without NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE entity_1 ADD COLUMN new_field VARCHAR(100);

-- Step 2: Backfill data in batches
DO $$
DECLARE
    batch_size INTEGER := 1000;
    total_updated INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        WITH batch AS (
            SELECT id FROM entity_1 
            WHERE new_field IS NULL 
            LIMIT batch_size
            FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
        )
        UPDATE entity_1 
        SET new_field = 'default_value'
        WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM batch);
        
        GET DIAGNOSTICS total_updated = ROW_COUNT;
        EXIT WHEN total_updated = 0;
        
        PERFORM pg_sleep(0.1);  -- Prevent lock contention
        COMMIT;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Step 3: Add constraint after backfill
ALTER TABLE entity_1 ALTER COLUMN new_field SET NOT NULL;
\`\`\`

### Backup & Recovery

\`\`\`bash
# Automated backup script
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/postgres"
DB_NAME="production"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Full backup with compression
pg_dump -Fc -d $DB_NAME > "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.dump"

# Point-in-time recovery setup
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'test ! -f /archive/%f && cp %p /archive/%f'
wal_level = replica

# Restore procedure
pg_restore -d $DB_NAME -j 4 backup_file.dump
\`\`\`

### Monitoring & Maintenance

\`\`\`sql
-- Key metrics to monitor
CREATE VIEW database_health AS
SELECT 
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) AS active_connections,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') AS active_queries,
    (SELECT max(now() - query_start) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') AS longest_query,
    (SELECT pg_database_size(current_database())) AS database_size,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000) AS tables_need_vacuum;

-- Automated maintenance tasks
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

-- Daily vacuum analyze
SELECT cron.schedule('vacuum-analyze', '0 2 * * *', 'VACUUM ANALYZE;');

-- Weekly reindex
SELECT cron.schedule('reindex', '0 3 * * 0', 'REINDEX DATABASE production;');

-- Monthly partition cleanup
SELECT cron.schedule('partition-cleanup', '0 4 1 * *', 'CALL cleanup_old_partitions();');

### Security Best Practices
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implement row-level security (RLS) for multi-tenant data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Implement connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

### Scalability Roadmap
1. **Phase 1** (0-100K records): Single primary database
2. **Phase 2** (100K-1M records): Add read replicas
3. **Phase 3** (1M-10M records): Implement caching layer
4. **Phase 4** (10M+ records): Horizontal sharding`,

## Context
- Current Issues: [DESCRIBE_PROBLEMS]
- Tech Stack: [FRAMEWORKS_LIBRARIES]
- Constraints: [TIME_BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS]
- Priority: [PERFORMANCE/MAINTAINABILITY/TESTABILITY]

## üîÑ Refactoring Analysis

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Current State Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: [Calculate complexity score and explain impact]
- **Code Duplication**: [Identify duplicated patterns with line numbers]
- **Coupling Score**: [Analyze dependencies between modules]
- **Cohesion Level**: [Evaluate single responsibility adherence]
- **Technical Debt Score**: [Quantify in hours/days to fix]

#### Identified Code Smells

1. **Long Method**
   - Location: Lines 45-289 in UserService.js
   - Impact: Difficult to test and understand
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Estimated Fix Time: 4 hours

2. **God Class**
   - Location: ApplicationController class
   - Impact: Violates single responsibility, hard to maintain
   - Priority: CRITICAL
   - Estimated Fix Time: 8 hours

### üéØ Refactoring Strategy

#### Phase 1: Quick Wins (2-4 hours)
**Objective**: Immediate improvements with zero risk

##### 1.1 Rename Variables and Functions
\`\`\`[LANGUAGE]
// Before: Unclear naming
function calc(x, y, z) {
  return x * y + z * 0.1;
}

// After: Self-documenting code
function calculateTotalPriceWithTax(basePrice, quantity, taxRate) {
  const TAX_MULTIPLIER = 0.1;
  return basePrice * quantity + taxRate * TAX_MULTIPLIER;
}
\`\`\`

##### 1.2 Extract Magic Numbers
\`\`\`[LANGUAGE]
// Before: Magic numbers everywhere
if (user.age > 18 && user.score > 75) {
  discount = price * 0.15;
}

// After: Named constants
const ADULT_AGE_THRESHOLD = 18;
const LOYALTY_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 75;
const LOYALTY_DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.15;

if (user.age > ADULT_AGE_THRESHOLD && user.score > LOYALTY_SCORE_THRESHOLD) {
  discount = price * LOYALTY_DISCOUNT_RATE;
}
\`\`\`

#### Phase 2: Structural Improvements (1-2 days)
**Objective**: Improve architecture and design patterns

##### 2.1 Extract Method Refactoring
\`\`\`[LANGUAGE]
// Before: 200-line function with mixed responsibilities
function processOrder(order) {
  // validation logic (50 lines)
  // pricing calculation (40 lines)
  // inventory check (30 lines)
  // payment processing (40 lines)
  // notification sending (40 lines)
}

// After: Single Responsibility Principle
class OrderProcessor {
  process(order) {
    const validationResult = this.validateOrder(order);
    if (!validationResult.isValid) {
      throw new ValidationError(validationResult.errors);
    }
    
    const pricing = this.calculatePricing(order);
    const inventory = await this.checkInventory(order.items);
    const payment = await this.processPayment(order, pricing);
    await this.sendNotifications(order, payment);
    
    return this.createOrderConfirmation(order, payment);
  }
  
  private validateOrder(order) {
    // Focused validation logic
    return { isValid: true, errors: [] };
  }
  
  private calculatePricing(order) {
    // Pricing calculation with tax, discounts
    return { total: 0, tax: 0, discount: 0 };
  }
}

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Audit Report

### Executive Summary
**Overall Security Score**: [X/100]
**Risk Level**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Immediate Actions Required**: [NUMBER]

### üîç Vulnerability Assessment

#### Critical Vulnerabilities

##### 1. SQL Injection - CWE-89
**Severity**: CRITICAL (CVSS: 9.8)
**Location**: UserController.js:45

**Vulnerable Code**:
\`\`\`javascript
const query = \`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = \${req.params.id}\`;
db.query(query);
\`\`\`

**Remediation**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Use parameterized queries
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [req.params.id]);

// Or use an ORM
const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
\`\`\`

##### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79
**Severity**: HIGH (CVSS: 7.5)
**Location**: Multiple template files

**Prevention**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Input validation
const sanitized = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);

// Content Security Policy
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'nonce-{NONCE}'"]
  }
}));
\`\`\`

##### 3. Insecure Authentication
**Severity**: HIGH (CVSS: 8.0)

**Issues Found**:
- Passwords stored in plain text
- No rate limiting on login attempts
- Session tokens never expire

**Remediation**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Secure password hashing
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);

// Rate limiting
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5 // limit each IP to 5 requests
});

app.post('/login', loginLimiter, async (req, res) => {
  // Login logic
});

// Session management
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true, // HTTPS only
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 30 // 30 minutes
  }
}));
\`\`\`

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

#### Recommendations:
1. Implement MFA for all users
2. Use JWT with short expiration (15-30 minutes)
3. Implement refresh token rotation
4. Add CAPTCHA after 3 failed login attempts

    systemPrompt: `You are a performance optimization expert with deep knowledge of algorithms, caching strategies, database optimization, and system architecture. You identify bottlenecks and provide actionable optimization strategies with measurable improvements.`,
    prompt: `Analyze the provided code or system for performance issues and create a comprehensive optimization plan.

## üéØ System/Code to Optimize
\`\`\`[LANGUAGE]
[CODE_OR_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION]
\`\`\`

## Performance Context
- Current Issues: [DESCRIBE_PERFORMANCE_PROBLEMS]
- Target Metrics: [RESPONSE_TIME/THROUGHPUT]
- User Load: [CONCURRENT_USERS]

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization Plan

### Current Performance Baseline
- Response Time (p95): 850ms
- Throughput: 1000 req/s
- CPU Usage: 75%
- Memory: 2.5GB

### üîç Bottleneck Analysis

#### 1. Database Performance
**Issue**: N+1 queries causing 60% of response time

**Current Problem**:
\`\`\`javascript
// N+1 query problem
const users = await User.findAll();
for (const user of users) {
  user.orders = await Order.findByUserId(user.id);
}
\`\`\`

**Optimized Solution**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Single query with join
const users = await User.findAll({
  include: [{
    model: Order,
    as: 'orders'
  }]
});

// Or use DataLoader for batching
const orderLoader = new DataLoader(async (userIds) => {
  const orders = await Order.findAll({
    where: { userId: userIds }
  });
  return userIds.map(id => 
    orders.filter(order => order.userId === id)
  );
});
\`\`\`

**Impact**: 65% reduction in query time

#### 2. Memory Optimization
**Issue**: Memory leaks and inefficient data structures

**Solutions**:
\`\`\`javascript
// Before: Keeping large arrays in memory
const allData = await loadAllData(); // 500MB
const filtered = allData.filter(item => item.active);

// After: Stream processing
const stream = createReadStream('data.json');
const filtered = [];

stream.pipe(JSONStream.parse('*'))
  .on('data', (item) => {
    if (item.active) {
      filtered.push(item);
    }
  });
\`\`\`

#### 3. Caching Strategy
\`\`\`javascript
// Implement multi-layer caching
const cache = {
  memory: new LRU({ max: 500 }), // L1: Memory cache
  redis: redisClient, // L2: Redis cache
  
  async get(key) {
    // Check L1
    if (this.memory.has(key)) {
      return this.memory.get(key);
    }
    
    // Check L2
    const redisValue = await this.redis.get(key);
    if (redisValue) {
      this.memory.set(key, redisValue);
      return JSON.parse(redisValue);
    }
    
    return null;
  },
  
  async set(key, value, ttl = 3600) {
    this.memory.set(key, value);
    await this.redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(value));
  }
};
\`\`\`

#### 4. Algorithm Optimization
\`\`\`javascript
// Before: O(n¬≤) complexity
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        duplicates.push(arr[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}

// After: O(n) complexity
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();
  
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      duplicates.add(item);
    }
    seen.add(item);
  }
  
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
\`\`\`

### üìä Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Response Time (p95) | 850ms | 320ms | -62% |
| Throughput | 1000 req/s | 2500 req/s | +150% |
| CPU Usage | 75% | 45% | -40% |
| Memory | 2.5GB | 1.8GB | -28% |

### üöÄ Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Database optimization (N+1 queries, indexing)
2. **Week 2**: Caching implementation (Redis, CDN)
3. **Week 3**: Algorithm optimization and code refactoring
