  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How does Linear compare to Jira for software teams?',
      answer: 'Linear is widely considered superior to Jira for modern software teams. Key advantages: Lightning-fast performance (instant vs Jira\'s slow loads), cleaner UI with keyboard-first navigation, built-in AI agents for automation, and a generous free tier with unlimited users (vs Jira\'s 10). Linear focuses on developer experience‚Äîno complex configurations, just intuitive workflows. Teams report 50% faster task management after switching from Jira.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are Linear for Agents and how do they work?',
      answer: 'Linear for Agents lets you delegate work to AI assistants integrated directly into your workflow. Choose from various AI agents (powered by Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) to handle code generation, bug fixes, documentation, and routine tasks. For example, create an issue "Fix login bug" and assign it to an AI agent that analyzes the codebase, generates a fix, and creates a PR‚Äîall automated within Linear\'s workflow.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Linear\'s free tier really unlimited users?',
      answer: 'Yes! The free tier supports unlimited team members with 250 active issues and 2 teams. This is exceptional compared to competitors: Jira (10 users), Asana (15 users), Monday (3 users). The only real limitation is issue count, which is generous for small teams. Most startups can run entirely on the free tier until they scale beyond 250 concurrent issues or need multiple teams.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Linear\'s automation compare to other tools?',
      answer: 'Linear\'s automation is developer-centric and requires zero configuration. When a PR merges on GitHub, issues auto-close. Create custom workflows with templates, auto-assign based on labels, and trigger status updates from external events. Unlike Jira\'s complex automation rules or Monday\'s workflow builder, Linear\'s automation "just works" out of the box with sensible defaults that match how dev teams actually work.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes Linear so fast compared to other project management tools?',
      answer: 'Linear was built from scratch for performance: optimistic UI updates (changes appear instantly), local-first architecture with background sync, minimal JavaScript bundle size, keyboard shortcuts for every action (no mouse needed), and smart caching that preloads likely next actions. While Jira takes 3-5 seconds to load pages, Linear loads instantly. This speed difference compounds‚Äîsaving 10-15 minutes daily per developer.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Who are Linear\'s biggest users and why?',
      answer: 'Linear powers 10,000+ teams including OpenAI (AI research), Ramp (fintech), CashApp (payments), Vercel (infrastructure), and Retool (developer tools). These teams chose Linear for its speed, developer focus, and modern approach to project management. Common pattern: fast-growing tech companies that value engineering velocity and can\'t afford the overhead of traditional tools like Jira. Linear is particularly popular with YC startups and modern tech companies.'

        <a href="https://linear.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Linear</a> has revolutionized project management for modern software teams by prioritizing speed, simplicity, and developer experience. Used by industry leaders like <a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">OpenAI</a>, Ramp, and CashApp, Linear delivers lightning-fast performance that makes traditional tools like Jira feel outdated. The platform's AI agents, powered by integrations with <Link href="/tools/claude" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Claude</Link>, <Link href="/tools/chatgpt" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">ChatGPT</Link>, and <Link href="/tools/cursor" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Cursor</Link>, enable teams to delegate technical work directly from issues‚Äîtransforming project management from coordination overhead into actual productivity acceleration.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        What sets Linear apart is its obsessive focus on developer workflow optimization. Every interaction is instant, every action has a keyboard shortcut, and GitHub integration is so seamless that issues update automatically when code ships. The free tier's unlimited users (compared to Jira's 10-user limit) makes it accessible to startups, while the $8/user Basic plan delivers enterprise features at half the cost of competitors. Linear Insights provides real-time velocity tracking without the complexity of Jira's reporting, and automated workflows eliminate the manual status updates that plague tools like <Link href="/tools/notion-ai" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Notion</Link> or Monday.com. For engineering teams tired of fighting their project management tools, Linear represents a fundamental rethink‚Äîproof that developer tools can be both powerful and delightful to use. The platform's 10,000+ team adoption and consistent 5-star reviews validate what developers have long believed: project management software should accelerate development, not slow it down.
