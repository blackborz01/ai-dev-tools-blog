  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How does SWE-agent achieve such high success rates on SWE-bench?',
      answer: 'SWE-agent\'s success comes from its Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) design‚Äîsimple, LM-centric commands that make it easy for models to browse repositories, view, edit, and execute code. Unlike complex tool systems, ACI provides intuitive feedback formats that LMs understand naturally. The 65% success rate on SWE-bench verified (68% with Mini-SWE-agent) demonstrates that simplicity beats complexity. Princeton researchers spent years optimizing these interfaces specifically for code tasks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the actual cost of running SWE-agent?',
      answer: 'SWE-agent itself is completely free and open-source. You only pay for LLM API usage: Claude 3.5 Sonnet costs ~$0.14 per issue (39% solve rate), DeepSeek V3 costs ~$0.01 per issue (30.7% solve rate), GPT-4o costs ~$0.20 per issue (similar performance to Claude). Compare this to Devin at $2.25+ per ACU or commercial solutions at $20+ per issue. For a team fixing 100 issues monthly, that\'s $14 with Claude vs $225+ with Devin.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Mini-SWE-agent achieve 68% in just 100 lines of code?',
      answer: 'Mini-SWE-agent proves that complexity isn\'t necessary for performance. It strips away everything except bash commands‚Äîno special tools, no tool-calling APIs, just pure command execution. This radical simplicity means it works with ANY language model, even basic ones. The 100-line implementation focuses on core logic: understanding the issue, navigating code, making edits, and testing. It\'s a masterclass in engineering elegance and perfect for researchers wanting to understand agent fundamentals.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is EnIGMA mode for cybersecurity?',
      answer: 'EnIGMA is SWE-agent\'s specialized mode for offensive cybersecurity challenges (CTF - Capture The Flag). It solves 3x more challenges on the NYU CTF benchmark than previous SOTA agents. EnIGMA adapts the Agent-Computer Interface for security tasks: vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and flag extraction. This demonstrates SWE-agent\'s flexibility‚Äîthe same architecture that fixes GitHub issues can find security vulnerabilities, making it valuable for both development and security teams.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does SWE-agent compare to Devin or commercial solutions?',
      answer: 'SWE-agent outperforms most commercial solutions on benchmarks: 65% vs Devin\'s 13.86% on SWE-bench. Key advantages: completely free and open-source (vs Devin\'s $20-500/month), works with any LLM (vs vendor lock-in), single YAML configuration (vs complex setups), academic transparency (published research vs black box), and proven performance (NeurIPS 2024 vs marketing claims). While Devin offers a polished UI and cloud hosting, SWE-agent provides superior performance and freedom.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes SWE-agent ideal for research and experimentation?',
      answer: 'Princeton designed SWE-agent specifically for research: simple and hackable by design, single YAML configuration file, fully documented codebase, academic paper explaining every decision, and open benchmarking on SWE-bench. Researchers can easily modify the Agent-Computer Interface, experiment with different LLMs, or adapt it for new domains. The Mini-SWE-agent variant is perfect for understanding core concepts. With Princeton and Stanford backing, it\'s the academic standard for autonomous software engineering research.'

        <a href="https://swe-agent.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">SWE-agent</a> from Princeton NLP represents the pinnacle of open-source autonomous software engineering, achieving a remarkable 65% success rate on SWE-bench verified‚Äînearly 5x better than <Link href="/tools/devin" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Devin</Link>'s 13.86%. Presented at NeurIPS 2024, this academic powerhouse proves that thoughtful design beats brute force: their Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) provides simple, LM-centric commands that make it easy for models like <Link href="/tools/claude" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Claude 3.7</Link> or GPT-4o to navigate codebases, fix bugs, and even solve cybersecurity challenges with the EnIGMA mode.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        What makes SWE-agent revolutionary isn't just its performance‚Äîit's the democratization of autonomous coding. While commercial solutions charge hundreds per month, SWE-agent is completely free and open-source, with costs as low as $0.01 per issue using DeepSeek V3. The Mini-SWE-agent variant achieves an astounding 68% success rate in just 100 lines of Python, proving that elegant simplicity trumps over-engineering. Unlike <Link href="/tools/autogpt" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">AutoGPT</Link>'s complex plugin system or <Link href="/tools/devin" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Devin</Link>'s proprietary platform, SWE-agent's single YAML configuration and transparent academic approach make it the gold standard for both researchers and practitioners. For teams tired of paying the "AI tax" for inferior results, SWE-agent delivers state-of-the-art performance at API cost only‚Äîtrue AI democratization from Princeton's labs to your repository.
