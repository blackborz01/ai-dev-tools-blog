  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How does Zapier AI pricing work with all the modules?',
      answer: 'Zapier uses modular pricing in 2025. Start with a base plan: Free ($0, 100 tasks), Professional ($29.99, 750 tasks), or Team ($103.50). Then add AI modules as needed: Central AI Agents ($50/month for 1,500 activities), Chatbots ($20-100/month), Tables ($20/month), Interfaces ($20/month). This means a typical power user might pay: $29.99 base + $50 agents + $20 chatbots = ~$100/month. While modular pricing lets you pay only for what you use, costs can add up quickly if you need multiple AI features.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is Zapier Central and how do AI agents work?',
      answer: 'Zapier Central is an AI workspace where you create autonomous agents that work across 8,000+ apps. These agents can: qualify leads by researching companies and enriching data, handle customer support by analyzing sentiment and routing tickets, generate content by researching topics and creating drafts, and manage workflows without manual triggers. Agents understand natural language, learn from your instructions, and perform complex multi-step tasks. At $50/month for 1,500 activities, each action (browsing, data review, app interaction) counts as an activity. It\'s like hiring AI employees that work 24/7 across all your apps.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Zapier Copilot make building automations easier?',
      answer: 'Zapier Copilot revolutionizes Zap building with AI assistance: describe what you want in plain English and Copilot drafts the entire workflow, suggests the right apps and actions for your goal, auto-maps fields between apps intelligently, explains complex steps in simple terms, and helps debug errors. Recent 2025 updates added progressive building (create Zaps step-by-step), editing existing Zaps with AI, and auto-selecting app connections. Copilot is included free in all plans, making complex automation accessible to non-technical users. What used to take 30 minutes of configuration now takes 5 minutes of conversation.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Zapier worth it compared to Make, n8n, or IFTTT?',
      answer: 'Zapier excels with 8,000+ integrations (vs Make\'s 1,500, n8n\'s 400, IFTTT\'s 700), making it the clear winner for app coverage. The AI features (Copilot, Central, Chatbots) are unmatched by competitors. However, Zapier is pricier: Make starts at $9/month with more tasks, n8n offers self-hosting for privacy, IFTTT is simpler and cheaper at $2.92. Choose Zapier if you need: maximum app coverage, AI-powered automation, enterprise features, or no-code simplicity. Choose alternatives if you want: lower costs (Make/IFTTT), self-hosting (n8n), or simple triggers (IFTTT).'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the task limits and how do overages work?',
      answer: 'Tasks are individual actions in your Zaps (trigger fires, action runs). Plans include: Free (100 tasks), Professional (750 tasks), Team (20k tasks). Overages are expensive‚Äîeven 1-2 extra tasks trigger a $20+ monthly increase. Monitor usage carefully! Pro tips: batch operations count as one task, use filters to prevent unnecessary runs, pause unused Zaps, and consider upgrading before hitting limits. Many users underestimate task usage‚Äîa simple Slack-to-Notion Zap running 50 times daily uses 1,500 tasks monthly. Plan accordingly or costs spiral quickly.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do Zapier AI Chatbots compare to dedicated chatbot platforms?',
      answer: 'Zapier Chatbots shine through integration‚Äîconnect to 7,000+ apps instantly, unlike standalone platforms requiring custom APIs. Build and deploy in minutes with no code. Pricing is competitive: Free (2 chatbots), Pro ($20 for 5), Advanced ($100 for 20). Compare to Intercom ($39+), Drift ($50+), or ChatBot ($52+). Zapier chatbots excel at: routing to human agents based on sentiment, updating CRM records during conversations, triggering complex workflows from chat, and pulling data from multiple sources. Limitations include less UI customization than dedicated platforms and simpler NLP than enterprise chatbots. Perfect for SMBs wanting integrated automation, not just chat.'
