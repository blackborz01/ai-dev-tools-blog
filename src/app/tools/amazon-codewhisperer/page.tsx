  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What happened to Amazon CodeWhisperer?',
      answer: 'As of April 30, 2024, Amazon CodeWhisperer became part of Amazon Q Developer. All CodeWhisperer features‚Äîcode suggestions, reference tracking, and security scans‚Äîare preserved and enhanced in Q Developer. The transition added autonomous agents, chat capabilities, and expanded AWS integration. Existing users were automatically migrated with no disruption to service.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the free tier compare to GitHub Copilot?',
      answer: 'CodeWhisperer/Q Developer\'s free tier is remarkably generous: unlimited code suggestions, 50 security scans/month, and 50 agent requests/month with just an AWS Builder ID (no AWS account required). GitHub Copilot has no free tier for individuals. The free version is fully functional for individual developers, making it ideal for personal projects, learning AWS, or evaluating before upgrading to Pro.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are Q Developer agents and how do they work?',
      answer: 'Q Developer agents are autonomous AI assistants that handle multi-step development tasks. You can ask them to "add a favorites button to my app" or "upgrade this Java 8 code to Java 17," and they\'ll analyze your codebase, create a plan, generate code, write tests, and implement changes across multiple files. Unlike simple code completion, agents understand context and can perform complex refactoring autonomously.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Q Developer Pro worth $19/month for AWS developers?',
      answer: 'For AWS-heavy development, absolutely. Pro offers 1,000 agent requests/month (vs. 50 free), 4,000 lines of code transformation (vs. 1,000), SSO integration, admin controls, and IP indemnity. The automated Java/.NET migrations alone can save weeks of work. Teams report 40% faster AWS development with Pro\'s enhanced limits and enterprise features.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does security scanning work?',
      answer: 'Q Developer scans code in real-time as you write, identifying vulnerabilities based on OWASP Top 10, crypto best practices, and AWS security standards. It provides fix suggestions with explanations. Free tier includes 50 scans/month; Pro offers more. Scans cover Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and more. It\'s particularly strong at catching AWS IAM permission issues and exposed credentials.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use CodeWhisperer/Q Developer outside of AWS?',
      answer: 'Yes, but with limitations. While optimized for AWS services, Q Developer works for general programming in any environment. It supports 15+ languages and all major frameworks. However, its true strength lies in AWS integration‚Äîgenerating CloudFormation templates, Lambda functions, and AWS SDK code. For non-AWS projects, alternatives like GitHub Copilot or Cursor might offer better general-purpose support.'

        The generous free tier sets it apart from competitors, offering unlimited code suggestions and 50 security scans monthly with just an email address‚Äîno credit card required. The Pro tier at $19/month matches <Link href="/tools/cursor" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Cursor</Link>'s pricing while delivering unique capabilities: automated Java 8-to-17 and .NET Framework-to-Core migrations that can modernize entire codebases, real-time security scanning that catches OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and Q Developer agents that autonomously implement features across multiple files. With support for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">VS Code</a>, JetBrains IDEs, and command-line interfaces, plus compliance certifications for SOC, HIPAA, and PCI environments, Amazon CodeWhisperer/Q Developer has become the definitive AI assistant for AWS development.
