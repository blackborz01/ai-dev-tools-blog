      question: 'Why is Height shutting down?',
      answer: 'Height founder Michael Villar announced the shutdown after 7 years of operation. Despite innovative AI-autonomous features and a loyal user base, the company decided to discontinue the service on September 24, 2025. While specific reasons weren\'t fully detailed, the competitive project management space and the challenges of scaling an independent platform likely contributed. Users have until September 24, 2025 to export their data and transition to alternative platforms.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I export my Height data before shutdown?',
      answer: 'Visit height.app/export immediately to access export tools. Height provides multiple export formats: CSV for spreadsheet compatibility, JSON for complete data backup including metadata, and PDF reports for documentation. Export includes all projects, tasks, comments, attachments, custom fields, and team settings. Download everything NOW‚Äîthere\'s no guarantee data will be available after September 24, 2025. Keep multiple backups and verify exports are complete.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the best alternatives to Height?',
      answer: 'Top Height alternatives include Linear (similar AI features, $8-14/user, direct Height importer), Notion (all-in-one workspace with AI, $8-15/user), ClickUp (comprehensive features with AI, $7-12/user), and Asana (enterprise-ready with AI, $10.99-24.99/user). Linear is closest to Height\'s developer focus and offers the smoothest migration path with a dedicated Height importer. Consider your team\'s specific needs: Linear for engineering teams, Notion for flexibility, ClickUp for features, Asana for enterprise.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens to my Height subscription and billing?',
      answer: 'Height should have already stopped charging for new billing cycles. If you\'re still being charged, contact support@height.app immediately for refund. Annual subscribers may be eligible for pro-rated refunds for unused months after shutdown. Cancel any active subscriptions through your payment provider to ensure no future charges. Document all transactions for potential disputes. The company should provide clear guidance on refunds closer to the shutdown date.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I still use Height until September 24, 2025?',
      answer: 'Yes, Height remains operational until September 24, 2025, but with limitations: no new features or updates, potential performance degradation as resources wind down, limited or no customer support, and possible earlier shutdown of certain features like integrations. Don\'t rely on Height for critical operations‚Äîmigrate as soon as possible. The service could become unstable or unavailable before the official shutdown date.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What made Height unique before shutdown?',
      answer: 'Height pioneered AI-autonomous project management with innovative features: AI copilot for automatic bug triage and backlog pruning, smart specification updates based on conversations, kanban-spreadsheet hybrid interface, natural language commands for task management, and autonomous workflow automation. These features were ahead of their time when launched. While Height is shutting down, its innovations influenced competitors‚Äîyou\'ll find similar AI features in Linear, Notion AI, and other modern project management tools.'

        <a href="https://height.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Height</a> was an innovative AI-autonomous project management platform that pioneered features like automatic bug triage, backlog pruning, and specification updates through AI. Founded by Michael Villar, Height served thousands of teams from 2018 until its announced shutdown on September 24, 2025. While the platform offered unique AI-driven workflows and a hybrid kanban-spreadsheet interface, it ultimately couldn't sustain operations in the competitive project management space.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        For teams currently using Height, immediate action is required. Export all your data at height.app/export before the shutdown date‚Äîthere's no guarantee data will be accessible afterward. Consider migrating to <Link href="/tools/linear" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Linear</Link> (which offers a direct Height importer and similar AI features), <Link href="/tools/notion" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Notion</Link> (for all-in-one workspace needs), or <Link href="/tools/clickup" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">ClickUp</Link> (for comprehensive project management). Height's shutdown reminds us that even innovative tools face sustainability challenges‚Äîchoose established platforms with strong backing for long-term stability. While Height's AI-autonomous approach was ahead of its time, its features live on in competitors who learned from its innovations.
