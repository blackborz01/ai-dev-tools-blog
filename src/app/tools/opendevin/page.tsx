  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Why did OpenDevin rebrand to OpenHands?',
      answer: 'OpenDevin rebranded to OpenHands to avoid confusion with Cognition\'s proprietary Devin and emphasize the collaborative, "all hands" approach to AI development. The name change reflects the project\'s evolution from a Devin alternative to a comprehensive platform for AI software agents. With 63.4k GitHub stars and 401 contributors, OpenHands has become the de facto open-source standard for autonomous AI developers, far surpassing its original goal of replicating Devin.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does OpenHands compare to the original Devin?',
      answer: 'OpenHands offers several advantages over Devin: completely free and open-source (vs $20-500/month), 63.4k GitHub stars showing massive community support, full control with self-hosting option, choice of any LLM provider (vs vendor lock-in), and transparent MIT license. While Devin has a polished commercial UI, OpenHands provides a rich GUI with VS Code integration, Jupyter support, and browser‚Äîall while being free. Performance-wise, OpenHands\' 37.4% SWE-bench actually exceeds Devin\'s 13.86%.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the real cost of running OpenHands?',
      answer: 'OpenHands itself is completely free. Costs depend on your deployment choice: Self-hosted costs only LLM API usage (~$0.10-0.30 per task with Claude Sonnet 4), OpenHands Cloud starts with $20 free credits then pay-as-you-go, or local development with your own hardware costs nothing beyond electricity. Compare this to Devin ($20-500/month), GitHub Copilot Workspace ($$$), or hiring developers ($8,000+/month). Most teams report spending $50-200/month on API costs for significant productivity gains.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the 37.4% SWE-bench score compare to others?',
      answer: 'OpenHands\' 37.4% on SWE-bench Verified is excellent for an open-source solution: better than Devin (13.86%), Aider (~35%), and most commercial tools. Only specialized solutions like SWE-agent (65%) score higher, but they lack OpenHands\' full development capabilities and UI. The 37.4% means OpenHands successfully resolves over 1/3 of real GitHub issues autonomously‚Äîremarkable for a free tool. Performance continues improving with each release and community contributions.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I use OpenHands Cloud or self-host?',
      answer: 'OpenHands Cloud is perfect for quick starts: $20 free credits, no setup, instant access, and managed infrastructure. Self-hosting is ideal for: production workloads, sensitive codebases, full control over data, custom LLM providers, or cost optimization at scale. The CLI launcher with uv makes local setup straightforward‚Äîmost developers are running in 10 minutes. Docker deployment provides additional isolation. Both options use the same powerful OpenHands platform.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes OpenHands special among open-source AI developers?',
      answer: 'OpenHands stands out with: 63.4k GitHub stars (highest among Devin alternatives), rich UI that matches commercial tools (not just terminal), presented at ICLR 2025 showing academic credibility, 401 contributors ensuring rapid development, true developer capabilities (browse web, call APIs, run commands), and active community (Slack for research, Discord for general). It\'s not just an open-source clone‚Äîit\'s become the platform for AI agent development, with companies building commercial products on top.'

While <Link href="/tools/devin" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Devin</Link> charges $20-500/month for a closed platform, OpenHands offers multiple deployment options: completely free self-hosting with any LLM, OpenHands Cloud with $20 starter credits, or local Docker deployment for maximum privacy.

With <Link href="/tools/claude" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Claude Sonnet 4</Link> as the recommended LLM, teams report saving thousands monthly while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities.
