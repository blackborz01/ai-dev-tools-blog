  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How does FlutterFlow AI Gen work?',
      answer: 'FlutterFlow AI Gen uses advanced language models to transform text descriptions into complete app pages. Simply describe what you want like "create a social media feed with posts, likes, and comments" and AI generates the UI, database schema, and action flows. You get 5 free requests on the free plan, 50/month on Basic, and up to 500/month on Business plans.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I export and own the code completely?',
      answer: 'Yes! FlutterFlow provides complete code export starting from the Basic plan ($39/month). You get clean, production-ready Flutter code that you fully own. No vendor lock-in - you can continue development in any IDE like VS Code or Android Studio. The exported code is well-structured and maintainable.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does FlutterFlow compare to Bubble or Adalo?',
      answer: 'Unlike Bubble (web-only) or Adalo (wrapped apps), FlutterFlow generates true native Flutter apps with 100% native performance. FlutterFlow offers code export (others don\'t), has 10x more templates, includes AI generation, and starts free. While Bubble costs $32/month minimum, FlutterFlow\'s free tier is surprisingly powerful.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What kind of apps can I build with FlutterFlow?',
      answer: 'FlutterFlow can build any type of mobile or web app - from simple MVPs to complex enterprise applications. Popular use cases include e-commerce apps, social networks, marketplaces, SaaS products, internal tools, and educational platforms. With Firebase/Supabase integration, you can build real-time, data-driven applications.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need coding knowledge to use FlutterFlow?',
      answer: 'No coding required for most features! The visual builder and AI Gen handle the technical complexity. However, knowing Flutter/Dart allows you to add custom functions and advanced features. FlutterFlow bridges the gap - non-coders can build functional apps while developers can extend with custom code.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does team collaboration work?',
      answer: 'FlutterFlow offers real-time collaboration starting from the Growth plan ($80/month for 2 users). Multiple team members can work on the same project simultaneously with live updates. The platform includes branching for version control, project permissions, and commenting features for seamless teamwork.'

        Starting completely free with 2 projects and 5 AI generation requests, FlutterFlow scales from solo developers building MVPs to enterprise teams deploying complex applications. The Basic plan at $39/month unlocks unlimited projects and crucial code export, while the Business plan at $150/month provides 500 AI requests monthly and team collaboration for up to 5 members. What sets FlutterFlow apart from competitors like <Link href="/tools/adalo" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Adalo</Link> or <Link href="/tools/buildfire" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">BuildFire</Link> is the combination of visual simplicity, AI assistance, and professional code output‚Äîagencies report delivering client apps 5x faster while maintaining full code ownership. With Google's <a href="https://flutter.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300">Flutter framework</a> as its foundation and recent launch of Dreamflow AI capabilities, FlutterFlow represents the future where AI and visual tools democratize native app development without sacrificing performance or flexibility.
